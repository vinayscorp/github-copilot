# Exploring the  Cryptocurrency Market

## Introduction

   Crytpocurrencies are digital currencies that use cryptography for security and are powered by blockchain technology.

Since the release of bitcoin, over 6,000 altcoins (alternative variants of bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies) have been created.

## EXERCISE

    The objective of this project is to explore the Cryptocurrency Market. The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory). The dataset has one csv file for each currency. Price history is available on a daily basis from April 28, 2013. This dataset has the historical price information of some of the top crypto currencies by market capitalization. The dataset contains the following columns:

        - Date : date of observation
        - Open : Opening price on the given day
        - High : Highest price on the given day
        - Low : Lowest price on the given day
        - Close : Closing price on the given day
        - Volume : Volume of transactions on the given day
        - Market Cap : Market capitalization in USD

### Some of the questions which could be inferred from this dataset are:

    How did the historical prices / market capitalizations of various currencies change over time?
    How big is Bitcoin compared with the rest of the cryptocurrencies
    Predicting the future price of the currencies
    Which currencies are more volatile and which ones are more stable?
    How does the price fluctuations of currencies correlate with each other?
    Seasonal trend in the price fluctuations
